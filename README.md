![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bfec654c-9f75-489c-ae0e-e0feee2f7130)

A tool to detect potential cheating methods during online interviews.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- Git
- For macOS:
  - Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`
  - Additional build tools: `brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib librsvg pixman`
- For Windows:
  - Visual Studio Build Tools with C++ support
  - Python (2.7 or 3.x)

## Setup & Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd detect-interview-cheaters
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Install Electron globally (first time only):
```bash
npm install -g electron
```

4. Start the application:
```bash
npm start
```

## Development

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter build errors:
1. Make sure all prerequisites are installed
2. Try clearing npm cache: `npm cache clean --force`
3. Delete node_modules and package-lock.json, then run `npm install` again
4. For macOS users: If you get permission errors, run `sudo chown -R $USER ~/.npm`

## Features

- **Display Configuration Check**: Detects if multiple displays are connected, which could potentially be used to view unauthorized information during an interview.
- **Screen Sharing Check**: Verifies if the screen is being shared to multiple applications simultaneously, which might be used to receive external help.
- **Keyboard Device Check**: Detects if multiple keyboard devices are connected, which could potentially be used by someone else to provide answers.

## Technical Details

This application is built using Electron and uses system information APIs to detect potential cheating methods. The detection mechanisms include:

1. **Multiple Display Detection**: Uses the system's display configuration to detect if more than one display is connected.
2. **Screen Sharing Detection**: Analyzes running processes to identify common screen sharing applications.
3. **Keyboard Device Detection**: Scans USB devices to identify connected keyboard devices.

## Note on Detection Limitations

Please note that this application provides a best-effort approach to detecting cheating methods. It may not detect all forms of cheating, especially if sophisticated methods are employed. It is recommended to use this as one part of a comprehensive integrity strategy for online interviews.
